I have submitted three python files and the textfile specified in the assignment descrption. All files should remain in the same directory. 

### File One
''' a1_452.py '''
The main portion of the assignment. This is where the training and testing of the network occurs. This is what you should run
to see how my network works. It can be run in a terminal(or command prompt) using
''' python a1_452.py '''
I used Python 2.7 for this assignment.
You may have to run using  
''' python27 a1_452.py '''
If you have multiple python versions installed.

### File Two
''' perceptron.py '''
This file contains supporting functions that are called in File One. This was just to make File One shorter and more readable.

### File Three
''' Perceptron_tool.py '''
This file is part two of the assignment, use a tool to create the neural network, and output the precision/recall of the network.
The calculated values for this are placed in the networkoutput_bestruns.txt file. 
To run in a terminal(or command prompt)
''' python Perceptron_tool.py ''' 
or if multiple python versions are installed
''' python27 Perceptron_tool.py '''
